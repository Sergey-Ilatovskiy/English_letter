 <div class="hello">
 <p>Hello Ben,</p>
 </div>
 <div class="shank">
	<p>Thanks for sending the advert of the diving centre to me. I am interested in this. However, i have some questions. </p>
 </div>
<div class="main">
	<p>In the advert it is not said, where exactly it is situated? Also, which water sports can i try there? Because if i do not know which, what i need to take. The advert says that the diving centre is open six days a week. But i want to know on which days? Lastly, what type of accommodation is available? The fact is I prefer to stay in five-star hotels. </p>
</div>
<div class="finish">
	<p>Write back soon.</p>
	<p>Cheers,</p>
	<p>Sergey</p>
